* Raspberry Pi Hacks
This is a collection of pre-init hacks for Ubuntu Raspberry Pi. There are two
main reasons to do this:

1. Disable U-Boot

Ubuntu uses U-Boot to boot by default (not 100% sure why, but I think it's to
enable kernel rollbacks). U-Boot seems to be incapable of booting if a
non-serial UART devices (like the GPS receiver) is hooked up, so we disable it
according to [[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ARM/RaspberryPi#Boot_sequence][these instructions]].

2. Disable serial UART

Again, this is so the GPS will work. Devices should be able to be hooked up over
SSH so no real reason to use a serial console in most cases anyway.

3. User-Data config

This is just fun headless provisioning stuff (setting hostname + SSH keys).

The original files are stored in the repo for reference.

** Usage
Use the ~prep-boot~ script with the boot partition and the target hostname.
