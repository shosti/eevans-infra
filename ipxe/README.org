* iPXE
This is a quick script to make a custom iPXE binary with an embedded script (to
point to matchbox) and upload it to pfSense. To configure the tftp boot:

- Go to https://pfsense.eevans.me/services_dhcp.php
- "TFTP Server" should be the pfSense address (on the right interface)
- "Next Server" should also be that (not 100% sure what the difference is)
- "Default BIOS file name" should be undionly.kpxe

Servers need to boot in BIOS mode, not UEFI (it's possible to configure iPXE for
UEFI but doesn't seem to be worth the bother).
