* Flatcar Secrets Handling

This is a collection of weird hacks for using encrypted USB thumb drives for
secrets on flatcar (since FDE is basically impossible). Encryption/decryption is
handled through clevis/tang. There are a variety of hacks involved because
clevis is super buggy ðŸ˜ž.

** Prepping Drive
Use the prep-drive script (with the *device*, not the partition) to set up a new
drive that's ready for encryption.

** Mounting the drive
Use the mount-drive script to mount it and put stuff on it.

** Configuration
The config file contains the clevis config.
