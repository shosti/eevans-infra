* SRIOV Operator
** Installation
This one is a bit of a doozy. How I got these manifests:

- Cloned https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/sriov-network-operator
- Hacked up hack/deploy-setup.sh to output to a yaml instead of directly applying ðŸ˜¨
- Ran ~make deploy-setup-k8s~
- Manual cleanup (in particular, have to get rid of "updateStrategy" crap in the
  deployment)

The Helm chart in the repo was hopelessly broken; hopefully they'll fix it at
some point.

To get the custom NIC IDs, you have to do some digging:

- Find the "normal" ID/vendor using ~lspci -nn~
- Find the VF device ID from ~/sys/bus/pci/devices/<addr>/sriov_vf_device~
